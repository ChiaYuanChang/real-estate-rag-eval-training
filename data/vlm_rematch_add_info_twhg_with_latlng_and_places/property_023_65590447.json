  "reasoning_log": "The matching process relied on identifying unique room types and specific features mentioned in the tags. Descriptions 9, 10, and 11 were easily matched to the public/external areas (Lobby and Parking). For the internal residential areas: Image_1 was identified as the combined living/dining area (Desc_1) due to the visible sofa and balcony light, leaving Image_2 as the central dining/hallway transition zone (Desc_2). Image_3 was confirmed as the enclosed kitchen (Desc_3) by the visible rear balcony door. The two small bedrooms were differentiated by decor: Image_4 showed childish pink bedding and an AC unit (Desc_4, Children's Room), while Image_6 was neater with blue plaid and curtains (Desc_6, Student/Office Room). The two bathrooms were distinguished by separation: Image_7 showed clear glass separation (Desc_7, Master Bath), while Image_5 was compact with no clear separation (Desc_5, Guest Bath). Image_8 was the clear match for the independent foyer (Desc_8). The two parking images (10 and 11) were differentiated based on the visual focus: Image_10 highlighted the safety mirror and dedicated scooter line (Desc_10), while Image_11 showed a broader view of separated car and motorcycle zones (Desc_11). All 11 descriptions were matched 1:1.",
