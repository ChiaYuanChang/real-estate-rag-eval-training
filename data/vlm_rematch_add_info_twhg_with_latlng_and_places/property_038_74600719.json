  "reasoning_log": "The matching process relied primarily on identifying unique room types (Kitchen, Master Bath with Tub, Living Room, Multi-functional Space) and specific architectural features (balcony access, external windows in bathrooms). Desc_1 (Kitchen) was uniquely matched to Image_1 (L-shaped cabinets, embedded appliances). Desc_3 (Master Bathroom) was uniquely matched to Image_3 (contains a bathtub). Desc_5 (Bedroom B) was matched to Image_5 due to the large sliding door and multiple windows indicating balcony access. Desc_2 was assigned to Image_2 as the primary living area with large light exposure. Desc_9 and Desc_10 were matched to Image_9 and Image_10, respectively, as they depict the same furnished multi-functional space, with Desc_10 specifically requesting a 'top view' perspective. The remaining bedrooms (Desc_4, Desc_7) and guest bathrooms (Desc_6, Desc_8) were visually very similar, sharing features like wood-look tile floors (bedrooms) and external windows/wet separation (bathrooms). These were assigned sequentially based on the high functional similarity described in the tags.",
