  "reasoning_log": "The matching process prioritized unique architectural features and room functions. Desc_1 (Living/Dining), Desc_4 (Garage), Desc_6 (Master Bedroom), Desc_7 (Dry/Wet Bathroom), Desc_9 (Open Shower Bathroom), and Desc_10 (Room with Balcony Door) were matched with high confidence to Images 1, 4, 6, 7, 9, and 10 respectively, as these images contained distinct, non-replicable elements. The kitchen descriptions required careful differentiation: Desc_13 was uniquely matched to Image 13 due to the visible staircase. Desc_3 was matched to Image 3 as it provides the wide, open-plan view encompassing both the dining area and the island. Images 2 and 5, being nearly identical views of the L-shaped kitchen with an island, were assigned to Desc_2 and Desc_5 sequentially. The three remaining empty secondary rooms (Images 8, 11, 12) are visually indistinguishable and were assigned sequentially to Desc_8, Desc_11, and Desc_12 to ensure a complete 1:1 mapping.",
