  "reasoning_log": "The matching process relied heavily on identifying unique room types (kitchen, bathrooms) and specific color cues in the bedrooms. Image_3 was uniquely identified as the '廚房' (galley kitchen). Images 9 and 10 were differentiated as '浴室一' (Desc_8, with a window) and '浴室二' (Desc_9, without a window), both featuring the distinctive black and white hexagonal floor and wood ceiling. Bedroom differentiation was based on color: Image_7 matched the '淺藍色牆面' (Desc_6). The remaining bedrooms (Desc_4, Desc_5, Desc_7) were assigned based on size and accent color: Image_4 and Image_5, sharing the warm beige accent wall, were assigned to the two largest bedrooms (Desc_4 and Desc_5). Image_6, being the smallest remaining white room, was assigned to '空間偏小' (Desc_7). Image_1 and Image_2 were clearly identified as the main living area and the entrance/hallway, respectively. Image_8 was determined to be redundant.",
