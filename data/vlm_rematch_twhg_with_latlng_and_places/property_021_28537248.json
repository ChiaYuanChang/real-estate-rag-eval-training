  "reasoning_log": "The matching process prioritized unique spatial categories (Bathroom, Parking, Driveway) first, achieving perfect matches for Desc_4, Desc_5, and Desc_6. The remaining four descriptions (Desc_1, Desc_2, Desc_3, Desc_7) all refer to ground floor open spaces (storefronts). Image_1 was uniquely identified as the empty, newly renovated space matching Desc_1 (emphasizing AC and complete lighting). Images 2, 3, and 7 depict the same type of space configured as a yoga studio. Desc_7, which specifies 'yoga/sports classroom configuration' and 'wall-mounted AC,' was matched to Image_3, where the AC unit is clearly visible alongside the props. The final ambiguity was between Desc_2 (focus on track lighting/depth) and Desc_3 (focus on storage/dual AC) for Images 2 and 7. Image_7 was assigned to Desc_3 due to its slightly clearer depiction of the stacked props/storage, while Image_2 was assigned to Desc_2, emphasizing the track lighting and deep layout.",
