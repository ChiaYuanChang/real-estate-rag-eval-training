  "reasoning_log": "The matching process relied heavily on differentiating between similar room types, specifically the three bedrooms and the two bathrooms, and distinguishing between the front and rear balconies. The main living areas were easily identified: Image_1 shows the living room facing the entrance (玄關), Image_2 captures the full open concept (客餐廳開放空間), Image_3 focuses on the dining area next to the large window, and Image_4 is the kitchen close-up. Bedrooms were differentiated by window size and wall color/decor: Bedroom 1 ([Image_7]/[Image_8]) has a small window and brown curtains; Bedroom 2 ([Image_9]/[Image_10]) has a large window and light green curtains; the Suite Bedroom ([Image_13]/[Image_14]) has beige walls and the crucial visual evidence of a connecting bathroom door in Image_14. Bathrooms were distinguished by lighting and storage: Bathroom 1 ([Image_11]/[Image_12]) has bright white light and horizontal wooden shelves; Bathroom 2 ([Image_15]/[Image_16]) has warmer, yellowish light (燈光偏黃) and a corner wooden shelf. The remaining utility spaces (balconies and storage) were uniquely identifiable.",
