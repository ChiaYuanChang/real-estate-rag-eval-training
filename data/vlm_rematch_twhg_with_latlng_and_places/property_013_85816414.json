  "reasoning_log": "The matching process prioritized unique visual identifiers, especially for specialized rooms (kitchens, bathrooms) and specific architectural features (e.g., dual windows, balcony access). The main challenge was differentiating between the four living room descriptions and the six bedroom candidates. \r\n1. Living Rooms: Image_3 was uniquely identified as the '開放式客餐廳' (Desc_3). Image_4 was chosen for '空間尺度大' (Desc_4). Images 2 and 15 depict the same room; Desc_14 ('裝潢新穎', '電視牆完整') was assigned to Image_2, and Desc_2 (general living room tags) was assigned to Image_15, resolving the redundancy in the description set. Image_1 was the remaining spacious living/dining area (Desc_1).\r\n2. Kitchens: Image_14 was clearly the '狹長型格局' (Desc_13), leaving Image_5 for the '獨立廚房空間' with '大量收納' (Desc_5).\r\n3. Bathrooms: Image_9 was matched to '深色磁磚' and '無窗' (Desc_9), leaving Image_6 for the general secondary bathroom (Desc_6).\r\n4. Bedrooms: Image_12 was the only room with '雙面採光' (Desc_11). Image_8 showed clear '連接陽台' (Desc_8). Image_10 was visually the '空間異常寬敞' master bedroom (Desc_10). Image_7 was the best fit for the generic, square, empty '臥室一' (Desc_7). Image_13 was chosen for the '狹長' layout (Desc_12) over Image_11, which was deemed redundant.",
