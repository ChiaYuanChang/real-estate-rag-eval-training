  "reasoning_log": "The matching process prioritized unique room types first (Kitchen, Bathrooms, Bedrooms) before resolving the ambiguity between the two living/dining descriptions (Desc_1 and Desc_5). Desc_4 (Kitchen) was uniquely matched to Image_6 based on the specific layout, gas stove, and door to the rear balcony. Desc_3 and Desc_6 were differentiated by their distinct tile patterns (marble-look vs. large dark squares) and assigned to Image_4 and Image_9, respectively. Desc_2 (Master Bedroom) and Desc_7 (Empty Secondary Room) were easily identified by their contents (Image_3 and Image_11). Finally, Desc_1 (Main Living/Dining/Kitchen view) was assigned to Image_1, which provides a comprehensive view of the integrated space and TV wall, while Desc_5 (Another View) was assigned to Image_7, which prominently features the dining area, fulfilling the requirement for a 'different perspective'. Images 2, 5, 8, 10, 12, and 13 were identified as duplicates or highly similar alternative views of the primary matched images and were excluded.",
