  "reasoning_log": "The matching process involved categorizing images into Living/Dining (L/D), Kitchen (K), Bedroom (B), and Bathroom (Ba) groups. Ambiguities within the L/D and B categories were resolved using specific visual cues mentioned in the tags. For L/D, Image_1 was chosen for the '開放式格局' (open layout) showing the kitchen connection, while Image_11 was chosen for '客餐分區明確' (clear separation) due to the prominent decorative feature wall. For Bedrooms, Image_5 was uniquely identified by the built-in desk area, Image_10 by the large sliding wardrobe ('大容量衣櫃'), and Image_6 was assigned the lowest light rating ('採光一般') due to its smaller window size compared to Image_4. Kitchens were differentiated by the presence and perspective of the bar counter (Image_13 vs. Image_14) and the standard galley layout with a back door (Image_3). Bathrooms were easily separated by the unique patterned tile in Image_7 versus the minimalist design in Image_8. All 14 descriptions were matched 1:1 to the 14 images.",
