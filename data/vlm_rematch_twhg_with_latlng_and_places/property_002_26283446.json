  "reasoning_log": "The dataset provided 10 descriptions and 10 images, resulting in a perfect 1:1 mapping with no redundant images. The matching was primarily based on identifying unique architectural features and room types: Images 1-4 depict the various angles of the high-ceiling living room and mezzanine structure (Desc_1, Desc_2, Desc_3, Desc_4). Images 5 and 9 were distinguished by the presence (Desc_5/Image_5) or absence (Desc_9/Image_9) of the toilet in the frame. Images 6 and 7 were confirmed as the upper-level dining/kitchen (Desc_6) and the ground-level main kitchen adjacent to the stairs (Desc_7), respectively, identifiable by the dark green cabinets and layout. Image 8 was uniquely identified by the extensive wooden built-in storage (Desc_8), and Image 10 was clearly the indoor parking garage (Desc_10) due to the rolling doors and floor stains.",
