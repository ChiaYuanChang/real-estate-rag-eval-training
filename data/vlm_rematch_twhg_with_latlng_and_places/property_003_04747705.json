  "reasoning_log": "The matching process relied heavily on differentiating between similar room types, particularly the two bathrooms and the three bedrooms, and the two views of the public area. For the bathrooms, Desc_2 was matched to Image_2 (no external window, brown tiles) and Desc_8 was matched to Image_8 (external window present, gray tiles). For the public area, Desc_1 (玄關/客廳, window side, electrical boxes) was matched to Image_1, and Desc_7 (廚房/餐區, looking inward) was matched to Image_7. For the bedrooms, Desc_4 was uniquely identified by the smaller, barred window (Image_4). Desc_5 (Master, window side) and Desc_6 (Master, door side) were paired based on the spaciousness (Image_5 and Image_6), leaving Desc_3 (Small Bedroom 1, good view) for Image_3. All 8 descriptions were matched 1:1 to the 8 images based on these unique visual cues.",
