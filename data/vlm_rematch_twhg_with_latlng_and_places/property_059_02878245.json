  "reasoning_log": "The matching process relied heavily on identifying unique structural elements and specific furniture arrangements, especially within the highly similar living room images (Image_2, 4, 5) and the three bedrooms (Image_1, 11, 12). For the living rooms, Desc_3 was uniquely matched to Image_3 due to the visible entrance door ('開門即入客廳'). Desc_7 was matched to Image_7 as it was the only image focusing on the dining area with a large table and refrigerator. The remaining living room descriptions (Desc_2, 4, 5) were differentiated by perspective: Image_5 clearly showed the '狹長' (narrow/long) layout and '樑柱外露' (exposed beams) required by Desc_2. Image_4 provided the widest view fitting '大坪數客廳' (large floor area, Desc_4). Image_2 highlighted the '家具擺位集中' (concentrated furniture, Desc_5). For the bedrooms, Desc_11 required '採光良好' (good light), matching Image_11 with its large sliding glass door. Desc_12 required '單面窗採光中等' (single window, medium light), matching Image_12. Desc_1 was assigned to the remaining spacious bedroom, Image_1. Kitchens and bathrooms were straightforward based on the presence of stairs (Desc_6/Image_6), balcony access (Desc_8/Image_8), and wet/dry separation (Desc_10/Image_10 vs. Desc_9/Image_9).",
