  "reasoning_log": "The matching process relied heavily on identifying unique structural elements and flooring types. Descriptions were categorized first by room type (Bathroom, Hallway, Living Area, Bedroom) and then by specific features (flooring material, presence of stairs/platforms, windows, and utility elements like electrical boxes or exposed wiring).\n1. Flooring was the primary differentiator: Image_7 (and redundant Image_1) matched the tiled living area (Desc_1). Image_8 uniquely matched the 'old stone/terrazzo' entrance (Desc_7). Images 2, 3, 4, 9, 10, 11 were wood-floored rooms.\n2. Specialized areas were matched immediately: Image_2 (Hallway/Stairs, Desc_2), Image_4 (Elevated Platform/Electrical Box, Desc_4), and Images 5 & 6 (Bathrooms, Desc_5 & Desc_6).\n3. The remaining four wood-floored rooms (Images 3, 9, 10, 11) were matched to the four remaining bedroom descriptions (Desc_3, 8, 9, 10) based on layout and specific tags: Image_3 had the largest window (better ventilation/light, Desc_3); Image_9 was the most distinctly long and rectangular (Desc_9); Image_11 showed a lower ceiling structure (Desc_8); and Image_10 was assigned the remaining multi-purpose description (Desc_10).\n4. Image_1 was identified as redundant, as it is a near-identical view of the tiled living area already covered by Image_7 (Desc_1).",
