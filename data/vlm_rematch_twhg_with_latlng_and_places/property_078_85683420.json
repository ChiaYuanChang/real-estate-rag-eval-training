  "reasoning_log": "The matching process relied heavily on unique architectural features and material consistency. Desc_1 and Desc_2 were matched to Image_1 and Image_2 based on the shared gray wood-look flooring and their spatial relationship (Image_1 showing the overall space and staircase, Image_2 focusing on the window with security bars). Desc_3 was uniquely identified by the combination of wooden railings and old speckled floor tiles (Image_3). The two bathrooms were easily distinguished: Desc_4 required a window (Image_4), while Desc_9 required an '異形空間' (irregular shape, likely under the stairs) and an extractor fan (Image_9). The four bedrooms (Desc_6, Desc_7, Desc_8, Desc_10) were differentiated by their window/balcony type and structural elements: Image_6 has an enclosed balcony (封閉式陽台), Image_8 has a visible low beam (頂棚樑稍低) and an internal door, leaving Image_7 and Image_10 for the two remaining bright, open-balcony descriptions (Desc_7 and Desc_10). Image_7 was assigned to the '寬敞' (spacious) description (Desc_7) due to its slightly wider perspective.",
