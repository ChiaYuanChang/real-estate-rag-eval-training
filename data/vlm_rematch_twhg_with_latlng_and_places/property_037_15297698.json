  "reasoning_log": "The matching process relied heavily on unique room types and specific material cues. Desc_4 (Bathtub) and Desc_10 (Shower/Newer) were uniquely matched to Image_4 and Image_10, respectively. Desc_5 was the only room specified with a '木地板' (wood floor), matching Image_5. Desc_6 was clearly identified as the covered balcony (Image_6) due to the plants and storage items. Desc_1 was the main living area, uniquely featuring the integrated staircase and unfinished walls (Image_1). The staircase views were separated into the main run (Desc_7 -> Image_8) and the landing/turn (Desc_8 -> Image_7). The remaining three tiled bedrooms (Desc_2, Desc_3, Desc_9) were differentiated by the presence of a visible interior door in Image_3 (matched to Desc_3). Image_2 and Image_9, being visually almost identical, were assigned to Desc_2 and Desc_9 sequentially, as they both fit the '寬敞' (spacious) criteria.",
