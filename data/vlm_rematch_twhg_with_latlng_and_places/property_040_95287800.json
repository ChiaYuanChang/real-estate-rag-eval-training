  "reasoning_log": "The matching process relied heavily on identifying unique architectural features, especially within the bathroom and bedroom categories. For bathrooms, the key differentiators were: presence/absence of a tub (Desc_7, Desc_8), type of separation (fully enclosed glass vs. floor drain only vs. none), and specific vanity/storage features (e.g., open storage in Desc_5/Image_5, mirror cabinet in Desc_3/Image_3 and Desc_10/Image_13). For bedrooms, the distinction was based on flooring (tile vs. wood-look tile) and window configuration (single window, double windows/corner room, or massive sliding doors). Image_1 (carport), Image_2 (stairs/living), and Image_4 (kitchen) were unique and matched immediately. The final assignments for the four secondary bathrooms (Desc_3, Desc_5, Desc_10, Desc_13) and the four secondary bedrooms (Desc_6, Desc_9, Desc_11, Desc_12, Desc_14) were resolved by prioritizing specific tags like '雙面採光' (Desc_12/Image_12) and '收納鏡櫃' (Desc_10/Image_13).",
