  "reasoning_log": "The matching process prioritized unique room types and highly specific visual tags. Desc_2 (Kitchen) and Desc_4 (Empty Bedroom) were immediately matched to Image_4 and Image_8, respectively, as they represent unique room functions among the candidates. The two bathrooms (Desc_3 and Desc_5) were differentiated by the presence of a 'safety grab bar' (備有安全扶手). Image_7 clearly shows this feature, making it the definitive match for Desc_3. Image_9, the remaining distinct bathroom view, was assigned to Desc_5. For Desc_1 (Living Room), Image_11 was selected because it uniquely captures the living area, the entrance door, and the adjacent kitchen/storage area simultaneously, confirming the tags '玄關區隱約劃分' (entrance defined) and '靠廚房動線順' (smooth flow near kitchen). Images 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, and 12 are considered redundant views of the living room or the first bathroom.",
