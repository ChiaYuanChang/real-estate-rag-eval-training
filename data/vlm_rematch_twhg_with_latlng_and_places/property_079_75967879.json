  "reasoning_log": "The matching process relied heavily on identifying unique architectural features and fixed installations. Kitchen (Image_5, back door), Dining Room (Image_4, tiled walls), and Garage (Image_15, striped floor) were matched with 100% certainty. The three Living Room views (Images 1, 2, 3) were differentiated by specific features: Image_3 showed the 'multiple windows' and 'shoe area' (玄關), while Image_1 showed the connection to the dining area. Bedrooms were separated based on the presence of built-in cabinets (Image_9) or accent walls (Images 6, 7). The two multi-functional room descriptions (Desc_11, Desc_12) were assigned to the two angles of the room featuring extensive built-in storage (Images 11, 12). Bathrooms were distinguished by their tile patterns and ceiling materials (Image_10: patterned floor; Image_13: wood ceiling/black wall; Image_14: all white). Although Desc_13 and Desc_14 are labeled as two angles of the same room, the visual evidence suggests they are two distinct bathrooms (Image_13 and Image_14), but they were matched based on elimination and specific features (wood ceiling for 13, all-white for 14). All 15 descriptions were matched 1:1.",
