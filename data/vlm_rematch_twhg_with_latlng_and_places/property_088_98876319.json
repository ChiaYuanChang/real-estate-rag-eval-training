  "reasoning_log": "The matching process relied heavily on identifying unique architectural features and specific furniture configurations, especially for rooms that appeared similar (e.g., living rooms, bathrooms, empty bedrooms). Desc_1, Desc_2, and Desc_3 were differentiated by the view and the size/style of the TV cabinet and proximity to the balcony. Desc_4 and Desc_7 were distinguished by the context of the bar counter: Desc_4 describes an independent dining/entrance area (Image_4), while Desc_7 describes a connector/hallway with public/private separation (Image_7, showing the step-down). Desc_13 was uniquely identified by the '升降地坪設計' (raised floor) in Image_13. The two sets of duplicate rooms (Master Bedroom 2: Image_9/11 and Bathroom 2: Image_10/12) were matched by assigning the description that emphasized a specific feature (e.g., balcony extension for Desc_9, or narrowness for Desc_12) to the corresponding visual angle.",
