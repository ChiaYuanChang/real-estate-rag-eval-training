  "reasoning_log": "The matching process involved identifying key functional areas (Living/Dining, Kitchen, Bathrooms, Bedrooms, Utility areas) first. The three Master Bedroom descriptions (Desc_4, Desc_5, Desc_6) were confirmed to correspond to the three distinct angles of the same highly decorated bedroom (Image_4, Image_5, Image_6), based on the presence of the unique wood feature wall and built-in cabinetry/desk. The two bathrooms were differentiated by the dry/wet separation feature: Desc_7 requires 'good dry/wet separation' and an 'external window', matching Image_7 (glass enclosure and window). Desc_3 requires 'dry/wet not fully separated' and 'wooden ceiling', matching Image_3 (wooden ceiling, no glass enclosure visible). The three secondary rooms (Desc_8, Desc_9, Desc_10) were matched based on specific window types and built-in features (low cabinet in Image_8, corner window in Image_9, proximity to entrance in Image_10). The utility areas (parking and entrance) were straightforward matches.",
