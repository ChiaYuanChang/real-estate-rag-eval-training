  "reasoning_log": "The matching process prioritized unique architectural features (stairs, bay windows, kitchen layouts) and specific lighting/fixture details (recessed lights, adjacent bathrooms) before resolving ambiguities in the highly similar bedroom images. Desc_7 (Stairwell), Desc_2 (Utility Balcony), Desc_3 (Kitchen+Bath), and Desc_5 (Kitchen+Balcony Exit) were matched with high confidence based on unique visual elements. Desc_4 was matched to Image_4 due to the explicit mention of '天花嵌燈' (recessed lighting), leaving Image_1 for Desc_1 (Living Room with TV cabinet). The five remaining bedrooms (Desc_6, Desc_8, Desc_12 with balconies; Desc_10, Desc_11 without) were matched sequentially to the visually similar Image_6, Image_8, Image_12, Image_10, and Image_11, respectively. Although Image_11 does not visually appear '略狹長' (slightly narrow/long), it was assigned to Desc_11 by mutual exclusion, as Image_10 better fits the '方正' (square) tag for Desc_10.",
