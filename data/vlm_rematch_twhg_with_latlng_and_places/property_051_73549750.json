  "reasoning_log": "The matching process relied on identifying unique architectural features mentioned in the tags. Desc_4 was uniquely matched to Image_4 due to the presence of the '大面鏡櫃' (large mirrored cabinet). Desc_3 was matched to Image_3 based on the '附玻璃拉門區' (area with glass sliding door) and excellent natural light. Desc_2 was matched to Image_2 by the '長形格局' (long layout) and the visible '預留電線' (reserved wires). Desc_1 and Desc_5 both describe open kitchen/living spaces (Image_1 and Image_5 are visually near-identical). Desc_5 was assigned to Image_5 because it specifically mentions '廚房帶窗' and '濕區分色地坪', features clearly visible in both images, leaving Desc_1 for Image_1, which also fits the general description of an open kitchen space with basic amenities.",
