  "reasoning_log": "The input provided 12 descriptions but only 11 unique image candidates (Image_1 through Image_11). To fulfill the requirement of providing a 1:1 match for every description, one image had to be reused. The images were first categorized into two main studio layouts (Studio A: Balcony view, Dark Desk; Studio B: Wardrobe view, No Balcony) and two staircase views. Descriptions 9 and 10 were matched to the distinct staircase images (Image_8 and Image_9). The remaining 10 studio descriptions were matched based on specific visual cues (e.g., Desc_7 required a view showing the ceiling light and centered AC, best fit by Image_7; Desc_2 required a clear view of the green sofa and coffee table, best fit by Image_3). Desc_6, being a generic description emphasizing the 'full set' of furniture and crowdedness, was assigned to Image_1, which provides a comprehensive view of Studio A's layout, necessitating the reuse of this image to complete the 12 required mappings.",
