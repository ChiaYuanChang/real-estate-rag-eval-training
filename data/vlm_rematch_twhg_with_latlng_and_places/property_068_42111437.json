  "reasoning_log": "The dataset contained 15 descriptions and 16 images. Initial analysis grouped the images into Living Room (6 views), Bedrooms (4 distinct rooms/views), Kitchen (1), Dining (1), and Bathrooms (2). The goal was to match all 15 descriptions 1:1, leaving one image redundant.\r\n1. Unique Rooms (Kitchen, Dining, Bathrooms): These were matched immediately based on object presence (stove, dining table, bathtub) and specific tags (e.g., '老屋磁磚配置' for the kitchen, '設備較老舊' for Bathroom 1).\r\n2. Bedrooms: The Master Bedroom (Desc_6) was uniquely identified by the '可通往陽台' tag, leading to Image_7 (Image_6, a similar view, was deemed redundant as it lacked this visual evidence). The Study/Bedroom C (Desc_9/Desc_13) was matched to Image_10/Image_14 due to the built-in desk and AC. The two empty bedrooms (Desc_5/Desc_8) were assigned to the two visually identical empty rooms (Image_5/Image_9).\r\n3. Living Room: The six remaining descriptions (Desc_1, Desc_2, Desc_10, Desc_11, Desc_14, Desc_15) were matched to the six remaining living room images (Image_1, Image_2, Image_11, Image_12, Image_15, Image_16) by differentiating the camera angle and focus (e.g., '最廣角' to Image_11, '含走道' to Image_2, '特寫' to Image_16).",
