  "reasoning_log": "The matching process relied heavily on specific architectural and material cues. Desc_1 was uniquely identified by the long layout and built-in display cabinets (Image_1). The three main rooms (Desc_2, Desc_3, Desc_9) were differentiated by lighting and ceiling features: Desc_3 required good natural light and a decorative ceiling (Image_3); Desc_9 required a windowless, rectangular space (Image_9); and Desc_2 was the remaining narrow room with visible pre-wiring (Image_2). The three wet areas were distinguished by function and age: Desc_6 was the narrow, toilet-only space (Image_6); Desc_4 and Desc_8 were the two modern wet/dry bathrooms (Image_4 and Image_8, which are visually almost identical but assigned sequentially). The stairwells (Desc_10 and Desc_12) were separated based on the presence of wooden stair treads (Image_12 for Desc_12) versus standard treads (Image_10 for Desc_10). Desc_5 was clearly the old, tiled area with a kitchenette and stairs (Image_5). Desc_11 was matched to the small room with peeling green floor and old tiles (Image_11). Desc_13 was the only semi-outdoor space with a metal roof and cement floor (Image_13).",
