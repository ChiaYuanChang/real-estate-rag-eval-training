  "reasoning_log": "The matching process prioritized identifying unique room types (Living Room, Kitchen, Dining Area, Master Bedroom, Secondary Bedrooms, and two Bathrooms) and then used specific tags for differentiation. Desc_4 (Master Bedroom) was matched to Image_9 because it explicitly shows the '套房設計' (ensuite design) via the open bathroom doorway, distinguishing it from other bedroom views (Image_7, 13). Desc_7 (Master Bathroom) was matched to Image_10 due to the visible window, strongly supporting the '採光通風佳' (good light/ventilation) tag, differentiating it from the windowless/less-ventilated Image_5/14 (Guest Bathroom, Desc_8). Desc_2 (Dining/Work Area) was matched to Image_3, which features the long, multi-functional table and extensive surrounding storage. Desc_3 (Kitchen) was matched to Image_12, which provides a focused view of the complete, modern kitchen counter and abundant storage, excluding the dining table seen in Image_2. The remaining empty rooms (Image_6 and Image_8) were assigned to Desc_5 and Desc_6 based on minor staging differences, though both are highly suitable.",
