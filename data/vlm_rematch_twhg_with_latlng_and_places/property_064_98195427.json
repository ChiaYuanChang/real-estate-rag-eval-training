  "reasoning_log": "The matching process relied heavily on unique architectural features and specific furniture arrangements. Desc_1 and Desc_2 were matched to Image_1 and Image_2, respectively, as Image_2 provides the wider context of the open kitchen/living area shown separately in Image_1. Desc_3 was uniquely identified by its 'directly临街' (facing the street) and '狹長' (narrow/long) characteristics visible in Image_3. Desc_4 was confirmed by the presence of both kitchen cabinets and a wooden staircase (Image_4). The two master bedroom descriptions (Desc_5 and Desc_6) were assigned to the two different views of the same room (Image_5 highlighting storage, Image_6 highlighting the window/space). The four bathroom descriptions (Desc_8 to Desc_11) were differentiated by key structural elements: Image_8 (the only one with a window), Image_9 (the irregular, sloped ceiling indicating under-stair placement), Image_10 (the distinct white marble-look tiles), and Image_11 (the visibly narrow/long layout). All 11 descriptions were matched 1:1 to the 11 images.",
