  "reasoning_log": "The matching process relied heavily on identifying unique room types (kitchen, bathrooms, balcony) first, and then differentiating between the various empty rooms based on floor material, size, and window configuration. Desc_1 (Entrance/Foyer) was uniquely identified by the presence of the staircase (Image_1) and the highly reflective tile floor. Desc_4 (Living Room) was assigned to Image_4, which is a large open space with the same reflective tile, but without the staircase, fitting the main living area. The remaining rooms (Desc_6, Desc_7, Desc_9, Desc_11) were distinguished by their wood-look flooring and window layouts: Image_9 and Image_7 were clearly defined as a bedroom with balcony access and a standard secondary bedroom, respectively. Image_6 was assigned to the spacious multi-purpose room (Desc_6) due to its size and lighter floor tone, leaving Image_11 for the remaining bedroom/study (Desc_11), which features multiple windows and a door.",
