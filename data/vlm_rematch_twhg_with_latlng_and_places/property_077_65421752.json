  "reasoning_log": "The matching process relied heavily on unique structural and material cues. Desc_1 was uniquely identified by the combination of dark floor tiles and a high/sloped ceiling (Image_1). Desc_2 (Kitchen), Desc_4 (Balcony with chains/bars), Desc_5 (Bathroom with window), and Desc_7 (Wood floor, large window, AC) were all unambiguous matches (Images 2, 4, 5, 7 respectively). Desc_9 required the presence of a 'large sliding door connecting to a balcony,' which was clearly visible only in Image_10, distinguishing it from the similar living room views in Image_9 and Image_11. Desc_6 and Desc_8 describe two visually identical empty bedrooms with light tiles; they were assigned arbitrarily to Image_6 and Image_8. Images 9 and 11 were identified as redundant views of the same living room type, lacking a unique descriptive feature not already covered by Desc_9/Image_10.",
