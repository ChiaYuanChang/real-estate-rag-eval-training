  "reasoning_log": "The matching process relied on identifying unique room types and specific features mentioned in the tags. Public facilities (Lobby, Gym, Parking) were matched immediately (Desc 6, 7, 8 to Images 6, 7, 8). Bathrooms were differentiated by the presence of a bathtub (Desc 5 -> Image 5, featuring a tub and wooden ceiling) versus a dedicated shower stall (Desc 3 -> Image 3). The bedroom (Desc 4) was uniquely identified by its wood floor, AC unit, and built-in storage (Image 4). The three living room descriptions (Desc 1, 2, 9) were matched based on perspective: Desc 9 explicitly mentions the '書櫃平台' (bookshelf platform) and '另一角度' (another angle), aligning with Image 9 which highlights this unique feature and the wall decal. Desc 1 was assigned to the main, wide living room view showing the balcony (Image 1). Desc 2, focusing on '動線區' (flow/circulation), was assigned to Image 2, which captures the central axis and transition area of the apartment.",
