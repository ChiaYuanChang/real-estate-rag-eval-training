  "reasoning_log": "The matching process relied on identifying unique architectural features and specific furniture configurations mentioned in the tags. Descriptions related to the living/dining area (Desc_1 to Desc_4) were differentiated by viewing angle and spatial emphasis (e.g., Image_1 is the pure living room, Image_3 emphasizes the large open space). Kitchen descriptions (Desc_6, Desc_7) were separated by the presence of the step down to the utility area (Image_7). Bedrooms were distinguished by size and specific storage solutions (Image_9 vs. Image_11) or the presence of extensive built-in cabinets (Image_12). Bathrooms (Desc_8, Desc_13) were separated based on floor tile material (wood-look vs. white marble-look). All 14 descriptions were successfully mapped 1:1 to the 14 images.",
