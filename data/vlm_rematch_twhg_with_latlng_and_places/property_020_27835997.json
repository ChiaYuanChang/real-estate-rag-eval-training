The remaining challenge was differentiating between the multiple views of the living room and the two similar bathrooms and master bedroom views. Desc_6 (次臥1) was matched to the only empty bedroom ([Image_7]). Desc_7 and Desc_8 were assigned to the two distinct views of the master bedroom ([Image_8] and [Image_9]). Desc_11 was assigned to the other furnished bedroom ([Image_12]). The four living/dining descriptions were matched to the four most representative views: Desc_4 to the dining close-up ([Image_5]), Desc_3 to the combined view ([Image_3]), and Desc_1/Desc_2 to the two main living room angles ([Image_1] and [Image_2]).
