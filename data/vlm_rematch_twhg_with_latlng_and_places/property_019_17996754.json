  "reasoning_log": "The matching process relied heavily on identifying unique structural elements and specific furniture/fixture configurations mentioned in the tags. Desc_2 and Desc_16 were immediately matched to Image_2 (staircase in living area) and Image_16 (ground floor entrance/staircase) respectively. Utility rooms (Desc_15/Image_15) and the kitchen (Desc_6/Image_6) were also high-confidence matches due to unique appliances (water tank/pump) and layout (I-shaped counter). The Master Suite (Desc_3, Desc_7, Desc_8) was matched to Images 3, 7, and 8, which clearly belong to the same highly decorated area, with Image_3 showing the ensuite access and Image_8 showing the storage. The three bathrooms (Desc_5, Desc_9, Desc_14) were differentiated by the presence of a window (Image_9) versus the two similar windowless layouts (Images 5 and 14), which were assigned by exclusion. The four bedrooms (Desc_10, 11, 12, 13) were grouped based on size and shape (narrow/long for 12/13, spacious/square for 10/11) and assigned based on specific features like proximity to the bathroom (Image_10) or being a secondary view (Image_13).",
