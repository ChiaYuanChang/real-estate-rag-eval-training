  "reasoning_log": "The matching process relied heavily on identifying unique architectural features, floor materials, and built-in furniture configurations, especially for distinguishing between similar room types (e.g., the four bedrooms and the three bathrooms). The public area (Desc_1, 2, 3) was identified by the combination of glossy tile and wood laminate flooring, and the presence of a specific white console/altar area (Image_3). The bathrooms were separated by tile color (Bathroom 1: blue/dark tiles, Bathroom 2: large gray tiles, Master Bath: white/gray tiles with dark wood vanity). Bedrooms were differentiated by floor type (warm wood vs. light gray laminate), presence of a balcony (Image_8), and specific built-in features (desk vs. glass display cabinets). Desc_10/11 and Desc_12/13, and Desc_5/6 and Desc_14/15 were confirmed as different views of the same respective rooms, ensuring a consistent 1:1 mapping across all 16 items.",
